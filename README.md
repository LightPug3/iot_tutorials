# Internet of Things (IoT) Template - Tutorial

# Backend Setup
Always ensure to establish a virtual environment and install the necessary packages from your requirements file if you haven't already done so. Following that, activate your virtual environment and proceed to run your Flask API.

**The commands below must be executed from a command line terminal in the iot_tutorials/backend/ folder**
### Create a virtual environment

Windows 
```sh
python -m venv env  
```
Linux
```sh
python3 -m venv env  
```
### Activate virtual environment
Windows
```sh
.\env\Scripts\activate 
```
Linux
```sh
source env/bin/activate
```
### Install API requirements in the virtual environment
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
### Create **.env** file
Create a **.env** file in the backend/ folder to store the application's environment variables. 
Refer to the lab manual for the specific information that must be added to this file.

### Start Flask API
Windows
```sh
py run.py 
```
Linux
```sh
python3 run.py
```



# Frontend Setup ( [Vue js](https://vuejs.org/), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/all/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/))
### Recommended IDE Setup
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

Customize configuration
See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).


### In a command line terminal, execute the first commands in the iot_tutorials/frontend/ folder to initiate the dev server for the initial setup. 
### For all subsequent instances, only run the second command to start the dev server.
### Once development is complete, run the final command to generate production files. Please be aware that the generation of production files is not part of this course.

Project Setup
```sh
npm install
```

Run dev server (Compile and Hot-Reload for Development)
```sh
npm run dev
```

Create a production bundle (Compile and Minify for Production)
```sh
npm run build
```
